# Covid_Prediction
This project is about detecting a person infected with corona virus. 
The model uses Machine Learning Algorithms: Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression to classify these patients having being infected with coronavirus or not. 
The model goes ahead to make use of Deep Learning Algorithm as well. 
Often Machine Learning algorithms outperform Neural Networks when the dataset is very small. Since our dataset has only 50 images, we can see the accuracy of Logistic Regression and Random Forest is more than CNN.
